## ONPOINT is here

We're excited to announce the first public release of ONPOINT — the modern notes app for power users.

### Highlights

- **Markdown-first editing** — Write in markdown with real-time preview and syntax highlighting
- **Local-first architecture** — Your notes live on your machine, not in the cloud
- **Lightning fast** — Built with performance in mind from day one
- **macOS** — Available on macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and improve ONPOINT.
